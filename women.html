				<p> i)Vocational skill development  for women:

The skill level and educational attainment of the workforce determines the productivity as well as the ability to adapt to the changing industrial environment. A majority of Indian workforce does not possess marketable skills which is an impediment in getting decent employment and improving their economic condition. While India has large young population, only 5% of the Indian labour force in the age group of 20-24 years has obtained vocational skills through formal means whereas the percentage in industrialized countries varies between 60% and 96%. About 63% of the school students drop out at different stages before reaching Class-X. Only about 2.5 million vocational training seats are available in the country whereas about 12.8 million persons enter the labour market every year. Even out of these training places, very few are available for early school dropouts. This signifies that a large number of school drop outs do not have access to skill development for improving their employability, especially adolescent girls. Despite many programmes instituted by our government, the girl child still remains disadvantaged. The educational entry requirements and long duration of courses of the formal training system also form some of the impediments for a person of low educational attainment to acquire skills for earning a respectable livelihood. Further, the largest share of new jobs in India is likely to come from the unorganized sector that employs a very large chunk of the national workforce, yet most of the formal training programmes cater to the needs of the organized sector. 
 
The Finance Minister announced the formation of the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) in his Budget Speech (2008-09): 
"...There is a compelling need to launch a world class skill development programme in Mission mode that will address the challenge of imparting the skills required by a growing economy. Both the structure and the leadership of the Mission must be such that the programme can be scaled up quickly to cover the whole count
 Abhaya is committed to provide employable skills to women and to create sustainable livelihoods.  Abhaya has conducted several vocational courses for women such as basic tailoring, creative designing, jute and paper bags making, household cleaner preparation using eco-friendly materials, Food Processing  and such marketable skills that prepare the individual for earning a decent living and gain self-respect. 
Abhaya has also been associated with Sri Satya sai seva organizations in helping rural poor by identifying their requirements and providing suitable assistance enhancing their incomes. Abhaya has ably assisted the women in these regions by conducting vocational skill courses such as Agarbatthi making, Tie & Dye etc.
